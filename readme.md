# Brainfuck compiler in Bash

A bunch of years ago I wrote a [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) compiler in Bash for some reason. It doesn't do any optimization nor does it support any [extentions](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck_extensions).

## Usage

Give a file path as the first argument:

```
â–¶ ./bf.bash hello-world.bf
Hello World!
```
